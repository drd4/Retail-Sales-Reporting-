# Retail-Sales-Reporting-
A retail client collects data on its customers, their use of the retail website, and the purchases made. Our consulting team has already determined that the company would benefit from building a reporting infrastructure. To that end, you are being tasked with developing a monthly report that can be used on a regular basis.  In addition to building the report, our team would also like you to present recommendations on how to improve upon the infrastructure. We also want you to identify opportunities for the client to make use of the information youâ€™re working with in novel ways.
